# 🛡️ End-to-End Network Security Project  

A **production-grade machine learning pipeline** built for **network security analytics**.  
The project is modular, scalable, and follows an **industrial-level architecture**.  
Currently, it includes **data ingestion, transformation, and model training** pipelines.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Data Ingestion** – Reads and prepares raw datasets.  
✅ **Data Transformation** – Cleans missing values, scales features, and applies preprocessing.  
✅ **Model Training** – Trains machine learning models and stores them.  
✅ **Custom Exception Handling** – Captures errors with detailed tracebacks.  
✅ **Logging Framework** – Tracks execution at every pipeline stage.  
✅ **Pipeline-Oriented Design** – Each stage is modular and reusable.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Python 3.11  
- **Pandas & NumPy** → Data processing  
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine learning & preprocessing  
- **Custom Exception & Logging System**

## ⚙️ Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/End_to_End_Networking_project.git
cd End_to_End_Networking_project
````

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate the environment**

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate  

# Linux / Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the full pipeline with:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute:
**Data Ingestion → Data Transformation → Model Training**

---

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. Raw dataset is ingested from a source.
2. Preprocessing & feature engineering applied (KNN Imputer, scaling, encoding).
3. Model training on cleaned dataset.
4. Trained artifacts are stored for future use.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* ✅ Add **FastAPI** for serving predictions in real-time.
* ✅ Integrate **MLflow/DVC** for experiment tracking & version control.
* ✅ Extend pipeline with **Model Evaluation & Monitoring**.
* ✅ Deploy models via **CI/CD pipeline**.
